<template name="about">
  <p>ManTracker.co is a Culling site made by the community to organize tournaments every weekend and to keep track of player ranks during these tournaments. Eventually once we get more players, we'll add things like matchmaking and larger tournaments based on ranks. We plan to eventually add prizes to tournaments and announcers to larger tournaments.</p>
